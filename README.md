# Weather-App

This is my submission for The Odin Project/Full-Stack JavaScript/Weather App project.

It's a fully functional weather app that includes an hourly forecast, details for the current weather, as well as a forecast for the upcoming days.

## Features

---

- Geo-location API that prompts for location permission.
- A clock that updates every second to keep current time.
- Search bar for obtaining weather from other places.
- Random locations if the geo-location was denied by user.
- Dark and light mode based on users current settings.

**Name of the app is from ChatGPT and is not registered, any similarity to a legitimate business is purely coincidental!**
